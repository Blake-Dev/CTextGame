0,Home,Your place of dwelling. You're able to rest and collect yourself here.
1,Small Dungeon,A small but challenging dungeon. There might be some loot deep in there for you.
2,Large Dungeon,An upgrade from the small dungeon. Enemies here are stronger and more challenging.
3,Abyss,Nothing that has entered here has ever left. I wonder what treasures await.
